##  Summary

I learned how to navigate the Jenkins dashboard, where I can view all jobs, the build queue, and executor status. The interface makes it easy to access individual jobs and monitor their progress. I also explored how to view build history and check logs through the Console Output. Overall, Jenkins provides a clear and organized way to manage and monitor automated builds.
